# Responsive Restaurant Website Using HTML5, CSS, and Twitter Bootstrap
 This is a responsive website for a restaurant that renders well on a variety of devices (Desktop/Laptop, Tablet, and Smart Phone). I added Menu pages for Breakfast, Appetizers, Main Course, and Specials. Other features include Google Maps to locate the restaurant and click-to-call option. I had lots of fun playing around with HTML5, CSS, Twitter Bootstrap, and Bootstrap Grid System. I hosted the website through GitHub Pages.
Here's the link to the website: https://shreeu513.github.io/Responsive-Restaurant-Website/
