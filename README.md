# Responsive Restaurant Website Using HTML5, CSS, and Twitter Bootstrap
 This is a responsive web site for a restaurant that renderes well on a variety of devices (Desktop/Laptop, Tablet, and Smart Phone). I added Menu pages for Breakfast, Appetizers, Main Course, and Specials. Other features include google map to locate the restaurant and call option. I had lots of fun playing around with HTML5, CSS, Twitter Bootstrap, and Bootstrap Grid System.
